    <p>A new form of mobility has ushered in, bringing with it several misconceptions. Some of the common myths are
      busted here for you:</p>

        <p><b>Fact:</b> Electric vehicles are more economical when you take fuel and maintenance costs.<i
            class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></p>
      </div>
      <p *ngIf="fact" class="factpara">Every new technology follows an economic path where the initial upfront price is
        higher. This reaches a maximum and then decreases when people adopt this technology commonly. Electric vehicles
        are the same, but the higher price points are quickly changing as the costs go down. To help with high initial
        costs, many subsidies and incentives are offered by the government.
        The contribution to reduced life-cycle costs comes from the lower operation and maintenance costs as electric
        vehicles have fewer moving parts and less wear and tear.</p>

      <div class="fact" (click)="openfact1()">
        <p><b>Fact:</b>Cars spend over 90% of the time parked. You can plug in your car in this downtime at home to
          charge it. If you need to charge quickly on the road, fast and rapid chargers are entering the Indian market.
          Some electric vehicles can charge from 20% - 80% in about half an hour on these chargers.<i

      </div>
      <p *ngIf="fact1" class="factpara">The time of electric vehicle charging depends upon the type of charger used. As
        per the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, currently available electric vehicles across vehicle segments (2-wheeler,
        3-wheeler, 4-wheeler) can be charged from 0%-80% in around 1 to 5 hours from Slow/Moderate chargers while using
        Fast chargers, electric vehicles can be charged in less than 1 hour. Fast chargers are mainly used to charge
        electric 4-wheelers with bigger batteries.</p>

        <p><b>Fact:</b>Electric vehicles typically have a smaller carbon footprint than Petrol and Diesel Vehicles, even

            class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></p>
      </div>
      <p *ngIf="fact3" class="factpara">Electric vehicles can convert about 59% to 62% of the electrical energy from the
        grid to power at the wheels. Conventional petrol vehicles can only convert almost 17% to 21% of the energy
        stored in petrol to power at the wheels. Even CNG engines are not entirely clean as they emit ammonia and
        produce particulate emissions.While you might argue that electricity generated for electric vehicles also leads
        to carbon pollution, the amount varies directly with how the local power is generated. India has ambitions to
        achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy
        resources by the year 2030.</p>

      <p *ngIf="fact4" class="factpara">It is natural for drivers to be concerned about being stranded with a flat
        battery miles from a charging station, but as electric vehicles become more commonplace, their range is
        increasing. The electric vehicles currently available can easily accommodate the average daily mileage of Indian
        drivers.As per the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, the average range of electric 2-wheelers currently available in
        the market is around 84 km per charge, which is enough for day-to-day travel within a city. The average range of
        electric cars available in the market is between 150-200 km per charge. This range, when considered with the
        continuously increasing charging infrastructure, makes commuting even inter-cities easier.</p>

        grid has been nearly constant over the past few years at 0.82 tCO2 / MWh (as of 2018-19).As the share of
        renewables increases and dependency on coal decreases, the overall emissions from electric vehicles use will
        also decrease further.</p>

        two elements - dust and water. To give you reference, anything past 67 is generally used for specialized
        equipment such as submarines. Thus, your electric vehicle will not have any malfunction and will not conduct
        electricity in and around water if it has not been previously damaged.</p>
